Lesson 5: Assignment | Search and Sort Algorithms
________________________________________

Problem Statement: You are tasked with building a video search function that allows users to search for videos by their titles using the binary search algorithm. This function should provide fast and efficient search functionality, enhancing the user experience.
video_titles = [
    "The Art of Coding",
    "Exploring the Cosmos",
    "Cooking Masterclass: Italian Cuisine",
    "History Uncovered: Ancient Civilizations",
    "Fitness Fundamentals: Strength Training",
    "Digital Photography Essentials",
    "Financial Planning for Beginners",
    "Nature's Wonders: National Geographic",
    "Artificial Intelligence Revolution",
    "Travel Diaries: Discovering Europe"
]

You can use this list video_titles list in your Python code for further processing or manipulation.
Task 1:
•	Implement the binary search algorithm for searching videos by title.
•	Implement a sorting algorithm to ensure your binary search is searching through a sorted list. NO .sort() or sorted()
Task 2:
•	Develop a REST API endpoint using Flask that allows users to search for videos by their titles using the binary search developed in Task 1. This API should accept a search query via query parameter, POST request, or dynamic route, as input and return the matching videos, if any.

________________________________________
Expected Outcomes:
•	Successful implementation of the binary search algorithm for efficient searching of videos by title.
•	Development of a robust REST API endpoint using Flask, integrating the binary search algorithm from Task 1 to provide fast and accurate video search functionality.
•	Verify the correctness and efficiency of the search algorithm, confirming that the API returns the expected results for both existing and non-existing videos.
